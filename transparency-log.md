# US-RSE Code of Conduct Transparency Log

The US-RSE expects everyone who participates in the community will honor our
[Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/). This includes
anyone participating in any US-RSE-related activities, anyone claiming
affiliation with the US-RSE, and especially anyone representing the US-RSE
Association in any role (including as a volunteer or speaker).

This log serves to inform the US-RSE community about all responses to Code of
Conduct reports in a public, aggregated, and anonymized form. We believe that a
community must be able to see that a Code of Conduct is enforced in order for it
to be effective. Without a visible process, potential community members may not
feel comfortable joining. A visible log can also help the community establish
the social standards expressed in the Code of Conduct.

A public record allows the community to monitor the enforcement of the Code of
Conduct and propose changes to the reporting and enforcement process if
necessary. This log is updated once every six months. 

## Code of Conduct Reports and Responses

Updated as of January 27, 2023. Reports listed in reverse chronological order.

### November 7, 2022

A member reported receiving an unusual unsolicited direct message in the US-RSE Slack workspace in September. 
The reporter did not reply and no action was taken. 
On November 7, 2022, the same member reported a second Slack direct message from the same user. 
This unsolicited message consisted of a 56s audio recording. 
After reviewing the content of the message, the SC determined in consultation with the reporter that no action was warranted at the time. 
The two incidents have been noted for context in case future incidents involving the reported individual occur.


### May 9, 2022

The contact@us-rse.org address received two reports of potential code of conduct
violations from two US-RSE members. The reports were in regard to a post and
subsequent comments made in a public US-RSE Slack channel that were perceived to
have a hostile and antagonistic tone in a context that devalued the efforts of
other members of the US-RSE community. The CoC review concluded that the
language was negatively impactful and inconsistent with the CoC goals of
maintaining a “welcoming, friendly community for all”, regardless of intent. A
subgroup of the Steering Committee examined the CoC complaint. The group decided
that privately communicating the nature of the complaint to the reported person
was the appropriate action. It was decided that no further action was necessary.

### January 7, 2021

A message was sent to contact@us-rse.org to report an incident in a 1:1
interaction in a US-RSE Slack DM, with a request to keep the matter private.  A
response was sent to the reporter that the code of conduct review group could
not determine a responsive action that would maintain confidentiality, but that
a general reminder about the Code of Conduct would be posted to members on Slack
and in the newsletter.

### September/October 2020

In the process of verifying membership via email in September/October 2020, the
leadership@us-rse.org account received threatening emails. This email address
that sent the threatening emails was removed from all US-RSE lists and
membership.
